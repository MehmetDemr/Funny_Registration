# Funny_Registration

## Description
This JavaScript application provides a secure login and registration system. It allows users to register with a unique username and password, and then log in using those credentials. The system ensures password security by enforcing a minimum length and disallowing special characters in both usernames and passwords. User passwords are stored securely in a map data structure.

In addition to password security measures, the user interface features an engaging animated monkey character. This monkey character is responsive to mouse movements, adding an 
interactive element to the user experience. When users interact with the password input field, the monkey character playfully closes its eyes, enhancing the visual feedback and making the interaction more delightful.
